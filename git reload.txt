git add .
git commit -m "Reformatted Tasks Layout"
git push origin main



Things to come -
Reformatting the task console to create "lanes" for the different kinds or requests
Adding instructions in how to use it
Adding an Action Tracker interface to use all of the Productivity Tracker data
It will operate much like the one that Tim has built.
Repair email notifications for the Task Console.
